# Brazil National Test 2011

## Objective

This project focus on analyzing the results of 200 schools in Brazil's National Test 2011.


## Justification

According to studies when this project was developed, Brazil was placed 3rd in education investment on the global ranking. Even so, the country still ranks at the 89th position at the UN's educational index, a rather contrasting and worrying fact. With all this in mind, Professor Maria Teresa Leao proposed us to conduct a study on Brazil's National test, which is an exam organized on more than 56.000 schools nation-wide, evaluating middle and high school students.

Please note that this study was made during our early college years, and was designed as a training project for Exploratory Analysis, Hypothesis Testing and Sampling. In this context, the project is rather basic compared to more advanced statistical techniques, lacking modeling and such. Still, it is well constructed in its proposal and objective, and worth delving into.


## Choices and Metodology

Since this is a "beginner-friendly" project, Professor Leao kindly handed the data in perfect conditions, with no necessity of cleaning or transformation. The only data shaping process we did was a simple random sample of size 50 from the original 200, in order to make comparisons between the analysis of both datasets. 

After that, we conducted a series of analyses through multiple plots and tests, with the purpose of extracting key information from the data, whether it is about schools, their locations, a specific subject, etc.

In the end, we were able to gather many insights through our analysis, which is present in the "Trabalho\_Metodos1.Rmd" file. Please note, the whole analysis is written in portuguese, and there are required files for knitting the PDF file, all of which need to be in the same directory as the .Rmd file.
